### Informational Wedsite - Cookbook 
<p>I chose my cookbook website idea is to develope further for this projex. I think it could be acturely useful down the line and could be a fun way to expiriment with different techniques. <p>

<p>Over all I tryed to apply balenceby keeping the page symmetrical, other then that, I didn't really have a plan. I just wanted everything symmetrical and the same size. Changing to color of the background helped soften the transition between pictures and text, without building another table. Initially I had put all the pictures on the right and flouted them, but the page looking lopsided and the text was not lining up. So I desided to put the tect under the pictures which was much more difficult then I thought it would be. When I finally managed to got everthing balenced it turned out much better then I was expecting. I wasted a lot of time trying to work witht eh margins and float aspect trying to get it right, but in the end it was going to be more trable than it was warth trying to get all the picture the same size. At least I know how they work now thought. In the end I just put the pictures and text in tables. </p>
